# Student Performance Analysis

This project compares three machine learning models to predict student performance based on various features such as study time, previous grades, etc.

## Models Used:
1. **Linear Regression** with Regularization (Ridge Regression)
2. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** with Hyperparameter Tuning
3. **Random Forest** with Hyperparameter Tuning

## File Structure:
- `data_loader.py`: Loads and preprocesses the dataset.
- `linear_regression.py`: Code for training and evaluating the Ridge Regression model.
- `knn_model.py`: Code for training and evaluating the KNN model.
- `random_forest.py`: Code for training and evaluating the Random Forest model.
- `compare_models.py`: Compares the performance of all the models.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages.
